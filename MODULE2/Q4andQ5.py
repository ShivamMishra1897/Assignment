How memory is managed in Python?
    Memory management in Python involves a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures.
The management of this private heap is ensured internally by the Python memory manager.

What is the purpose continue statement in python?
    The continue statement instructs a loop to continue to the next iteration. Any code that follows
the continue statement is not executed. Unlike a break statement, a continue statement does not
completely halt a loop.You can use a continue statement in Python to skip over part of a loop when
a condition is met. Then, the rest of a loop will continue running. You use continue statements 
within loops, usually after an if statement.
