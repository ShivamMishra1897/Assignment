#What are negative indexes and why are they used? 


#Python arrays & list items can be accessed with positive or negative numbers (also known as index).
#for  an instance an array/list is of size n, then for positive index 0 is the first index, 1 second, 
# last index will be n-1. For negative index, -n is the first index, -(n-1) second, last negative index will be â€“ 1.
# if we do indexing in reverse order negative indexing comes into picture and is denoted by [-1],[-2]...
#[-1] being the first element from reverse and so on.

#We do this to display data from end of the list or reverse a list
