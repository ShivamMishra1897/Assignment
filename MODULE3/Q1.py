#What is List? How will you reverse a list?
''' List literals are written within square brackets [ ]. In python a built in function called revrse() is used to reverse the list.
Lists work similarly to strings -- use the len() function and square brackets [ ] to access data,
 with the first element at index 0. It is a simple way to reverse a list with little memory. 
 Syntax: list_name.reverse()'''
